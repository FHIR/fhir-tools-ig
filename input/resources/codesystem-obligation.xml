An example: IPA marks Patient.active must-handle and must-explain. Client applications must process Patient.active correctly if they see it, but many (though *not all*) specifications and/or applications ensure that Patient.active will never be false, and so it will never be populated e.g. MedMij in Netherlands prohibits use of Patient.active, and explains that it is never false."/>

      <display value="Conformant Applications SHALL/SHOULD handle the meaning of this element correctly"/>
      <definition value="Notes: this rule is vague in that doesn't specify any particular handling of the element. But it's important because an application that ignores this element is non-conformant. A good example would be a status code of 'entered-in-error' - how exactly a Resource Consumer handles this depends on the use case etc, but the application can never simply ignore such a status code. Note that whether the resource or information from it is stored for later use is irrelevant - when the resource or information in it is processed, the consequences of the element are considered. That may mean not retaining the information for later use, or informing the user, etc. Typically, this obligation marks that there are known patient safety issues that can arise if the element is ignored. Implementers should pay particular attention to the possible range of values for the element from a safety perspective."/>
