  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This IG defines extensions and their valuesets + code systems used internally by FHIR tools that support the 
    implementation community. These tools include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Validators</li>
    <li>Code Generators</li>
    <li>Profile &amp; Terminology tooling</li>
    <li>Implementation Guide Authoring Tooling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These extensions are not intended to appear in health systems implementations 
    unless they are concerned with code generation from the FHIR packages. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, there are a few extensions and logical models
    that are defined in this IG to allow for experimental use; once 
    more experience has been gained, these are intended to move into the main FHIR Extensions package (at 
    which time their URL will change). Those extensions and the supporting 
    terminology resources are clearly labeled.

	<h3>Tooling IG Lifecycle</h3>
  <p>
  This IG is not subject to formal balloting. It is maintained 
  by the FHIR-I Working Group on behalf of the tooling providers,
  and updated regularly to keep in sync with the various tools. 
  Changes are proposed and managed using the standard Jira process
  (see right link on the footer).
